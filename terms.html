        you play a Happy Pixel game, use one of the utility, productivity, or lifestyle apps (hereinafter individually
        the “App” or collectively the “Apps”). Our Apps are downloaded from App Stores such as the Apple App Store,
        Google Play, Amazon AppStore for Android, or other comparable App Stores (each an “App Store” or collectively
        the “App Stores”). The applicable terms of use of the App Store from which the App is downloaded apply to the
        relationship between the App Store and you - these terms do not govern that relationship.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>To use our Apps, you confirm that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The device you are accessing is your property and that you are authorized to make payments for features
          offered in the App.</li>
        <li>You are not located in a country under a US government embargo or designated as a “terrorist-supporting”
          country and that you are not on any US government prohibited or restricted party list.</li>

          discriminatory, or offensive in Happy Pixel’s view.</li>
        <li>Use the Apps to distribute information or materials that infringe or could infringe intellectual property
          rights, including those of Happy Pixel.</li>

        policy is available on our website and where you download our Apps.</p>

      <h2>3. Special Conditions</h2>
      <p>The terms of the App Store provider also apply to your use of the Apps and the purchase of paid features. In
        case of conflicts between these terms and the App Store terms, the App Store terms prevail regarding the use of
        the App Store. Additionally, special terms may apply depending on how you access the Apps. We or our partners or
        third parties may occasionally run contests or promotions, which are subject to additional terms (“Special
        Conditions”). In case of conflicts between these terms and the special conditions, the special conditions
        prevail.</p>

      <h2>4. License Grant</h2>
      <p>By agreeing to these terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable
        license to use our Apps for personal, non-commercial purposes. You must not attempt to hack into an App or gain
        unauthorized access to the software used by the App. Happy Pixel owns all rights, titles, and interests (or has
        a license to use) including all intellectual property rights in the Apps, including software code, visual
        displays, graphics, musical compositions, audiovisual effects, and trademarks of the Apps’ titles, and user
        content under these terms. Using our Apps under a license does not grant you any intellectual property rights in
        our Apps.</p>

      <h2>5. User Content</h2>
      <p>All data, texts, graphics, photos, and other materials uploaded or made available by you or other users in the

        does not guarantee the accuracy, quality, or integrity of User Content provided through the Apps. You agree that

        rights, claims, and interests, including intellectual property rights, in such content, including the right to
        grant all rights and licenses in these terms without Happy Pixel incurring obligations or liabilities to third
        parties.</p>
      <p>You grant Happy Pixel a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid-up, and
        royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, distribute, license, sell,
        transfer, publish, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, and otherwise exploit the User Content you

        the Apps.</p>

        pricing and your purchase and use of the Apps.</p>

      <h2>7. Paid Features</h2>
      <p>Some of our Apps offer paid features, which may include subscriptions, products, and other services or virtual
        items. You can “buy” or “earn” these paid features in our Apps. All terms of these terms and conditions for
        using the Apps also apply to the use of paid features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Prices are indicated at the time of purchase and may vary by country. The same
          paid features may be offered by third parties at different prices. Prices and availability are subject to
          change without notice.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of Loss:</strong> The risk of loss or damage to paid features passes to you upon electronic
          transmission of the paid feature to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Subscriptions provide access to certain services, software, and content
          available to subscribers. These subscriptions are tied to your account and are non-transferable.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic Renewals and Payments:</strong> If automatic renewal is enabled, your subscription will
          automatically renew at the end of the current subscription term at the then-current price.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Refund</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel is entitled to cancel a payment and refund you if we believe a purchase is incomplete or
        fraudulent. Refunds are processed through the App Store where the original purchase was made.</p>

      <h2>9. Payment Methods</h2>
      <p>The payment methods accepted by Happy Pixel include those offered by the respective App Store provider at the
        place of purchase within the App.</p>

      <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel is liable only for damages caused by intentional or grossly negligent behavior of Happy Pixel, its
        legal representatives, or agents. For slight negligence, Happy Pixel is liable only for breaches of essential
        contractual obligations. In such cases, liability is limited to foreseeable damage. Happy Pixel’s liability for
        damages arising from injury to life, body, or health is not affected.</p>

      <h2>11. Data Loss</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel is not liable for data loss if the user has not performed regular data backups, ensuring that lost
        data can be restored with reasonable effort.</p>

      <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel provides the Apps and all paid features “as is.” There is no guarantee that access to the Apps will
        be uninterrupted, reliable, or error-free.</p>

      <h2>13. Third-Party Advertising</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel may generate revenue from third-party advertising in the Apps. By using the Apps, you may encounter
        third-party ads and offers for virtual items from these advertisers.</p>

      <p>Links in the Apps may direct you outside of Happy Pixel's Apps to third-party websites. Happy Pixel is not
        responsible for the content or policies of these third-party websites.</p>

      <h2>15. Termination or Suspension of Your Account</h2>

        if you violate these terms.</p>

      <h2>16. Transfer of Rights and Obligations</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel may transfer its rights and obligations under these terms to third parties, including through
        sublicensing or transfer of rights.</p>

      <h2>17. Third-Party Rights</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that if the App was downloaded or purchased from an App Store, the respective App Store
        providers are third-party beneficiaries of these terms.</p>

      <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>

        remain unaffected.</p>

      <h2>19. Amendments</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. If changes are made, you will be notified in
        the Apps or through other communication means.</p>

        mandatory consumer laws of another country apply. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these terms
        and conditions will be decided by the Portugal courts. However, consumers may also have the right to bring an
        action before a court at their place of residence.</p>

      <h2>20. Alternative Dispute Resolution</h2>

          href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>. Consumers have the option to
        use this platform to resolve their disputes. However, Happy Pixel is neither willing nor obliged to participate
        in
        such a procedure.</p>

      <h2>22. Severability Clause</h2>
      <p>Should any provision of these terms and conditions be found wholly or partially illegal, invalid, or
        unenforceable by a competent court or administrative authority, that provision or part thereof will be
        considered not part of these terms and conditions. The validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions
        will remain unaffected.</p>

      <h2>23. Complaints and Disputes</h2>
      <p>Please contact us immediately using our contact details if you: (a) have any questions, complaints, claims, or
        concerns regarding content in our Apps, our paid features, or Happy Pixel in general; or (b) believe that an act
        or omission by Happy Pixel or one of our players violates applicable law. Happy Pixel will review your concerns
        and
        decide whether to take action and whether a player has violated these terms. Happy Pixel will endeavor to inform
        you of the outcome of the review within a reasonable time after receiving your complaint. Both parties
        acknowledge that the App Store providers have no obligation to investigate, settle, defend, or dismiss disputes
        concerning the intellectual property of the Apps. The right to object to a defect in the Apps or virtual items
        expires after three years.</p>

      <h2>24. Amendment of Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>Happy Pixel reserves the right to change or supplement these terms and conditions at any time with effect for
        the
        future, as necessary due to changes in the legal or regulatory framework, technical developments, or other
        comparable reasons. Happy Pixel will inform users of changes to the terms in an appropriate manner in good time.
        This may be done, for example, by a notification within the App, by email, or by a notice on the website.</p>

      <p>Users have the right to object to the changes within 30 days of receiving the notification. Objections must be
        made in writing to <a href="mailto:support@martingo.studio">support@martingo.studio</a>. If the user does not
        object
        within the period, the changed terms are considered accepted. If the user objects to the changes, Happy Pixel is
        entitled to terminate the contract with the user at the time the amended terms take effect.</p>

      <h2>25. Entire Agreement</h2>

        and exclude all other terms and conditions.</p>
